    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jamaican oxtails are tail portions of beef cattle cooked together with root vegetables, herbs, scotch bonnet pepper, and spices and stewed in their own fat until the meat is tender and succulent and literally falls off the bone</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds oxtail</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning (such as Spike®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon browning sauce (such as Grace®)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 carrots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>3 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps / Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place oxtail in a shallow dish. Combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, sugar, garlic and herb seasoning, browning sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Rub both sides of oxtail with soy sauce mixture; discard any excess.</li><br>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sear oxtail in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side; transfer to a plate and set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Sauté carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Add oxtail, with its juices, and butter. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until oxtail is fork tender, about 3 hours.</li><br>
        <li>Uncover skillet and increase heat to high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
